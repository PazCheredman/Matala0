Hello, our project contains a lot of classes. 
To better understanding our project we divided the classes you need to run according each Ex.
You must run all of the classes in the same order written below because each Ex relies on the previous one.
Pay attention to the comments written in the classes, they will help you understand what is the correct input.

Enter to folder *Version11*, that folder contains the most updated files of our project

Ex0+Ex1: run in this order:
	1. class "csv" - enter path of folder that contains WiggleWifi files.
	2. class "testKml"- enter path of gmon.csv 

Ex2: run class "main"- follow the instruction printed, it will provide you all the information needed.

	p.s.
	notice that in Ex2 we wrote specific paths so make sure to change it so it 	fits your computer and your folders.

Thank you for checking our project. 
Paz & Inna.
