Hello, our project contains a lot of classes. 
To better understanding our project we divided the classes you need to run according each Ex.
You must run all of the classes in the same order written below because each Ex relies on the previous one.
Pay attention to the comments written in the class, they will help you understand what is the correct input.
	
Ex0+Ex1: run in this order:
	1. class "csv" - enter path of folder that contains WiggleWifi files.
	2. class "testKml"- enter path of gmon.csv 
	
	P.S.: if you want to search by radious - run class "main".	
	
Ex2: run class "main"- follow the instruction printed, you will provide you all the information needed.

Thank you for checking our project. 
Paz & Inna.
